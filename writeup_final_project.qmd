**Impact of Commercialisation on National Parks in India**

As of 2023, there are 106 existing national parks in India covering an area of approximately 44,403 km2, which is 1.35% of the geographical area of the country. Many of these national parks, home to the ‘Royal Bengal Tigers’, have become prime tourist attractions of the country. India, with the effort of 50 years of Tiger conservation measures, now harbours almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population. Due to this remarkable increase in tiger sightings resulting from continuous conservation efforts, we have seen a commensurate increase in the higher commercialisation of national parks and tourist footfall. The goal of this study is to assess the implications of rising commercialisation on tiger population and further understand the sustainability of such conservation policies. The anticipated impacts of commercialization included forest cover depletion, a rise in tourism, increased economic activity, and a decline in wildlife populations.

**Data and Methodology**
For the purpose of our analysis, we make use of the forest cover data to explore the evolution of  forest areas in India over the years. Additionally, we use the Nighttime lights data to understand the economic activity in India over the years. The Forest Cover data and Nightlight data has been sourced from the SHRUG platform developed by Development Data Lab. The granularity of the data goes down till the village or the town level. We use other SHRUG data on location coding and coordinates to assist with plotting. 

The study explores these indicators mainly around two national parks : Jim Corbett National Park and Pench Tiger Reserve. Jim Corbett is located in Ramnagar, Nainital Uttarakhand and harbours maximum tigers in India. It is one of the prime attractions for wildlife tourism and relatively very commercialized to cater to increasing tourist demands. We choose this as one of our study areas because of its bustling development over recent years. Our next choice of study area, Pench Tiger reserve is located in Kurai Village, Seoni-Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh. It is home to just 77 tigers as opposed to 260 tigers in Jim Corbett and is relatively significantly less commercialised. 

To analyse the forest cover and night lights, we essentially look at three years in particular which are 2001, 2010 and 2020. We first analyse the mean vcf (Vegetation Continuous Fields) across India in the three years. For the chosen years between 2000-2011, we use the The Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) satellite data and for years between 2012-2020, we use the VIIRS nighttime lights data. We also use Tourism Data (both domestic and foreign) from Tourist Statistics Reports published by the Government of Madhya Pradesh and Government of Uttarakhand.
Essentially we make an exploration of how forest cover and night lights have evolved across the span of our study and draw comparison with tourism movements and wildlife census.

The coding of the project mainly involves three parts: Forest Cover Analysis, Nightlight Analysis, Tourism Footfall Analysis and Shiny Dashboard App. The forest cover and nightlight code involves using static visualisations using libraries like matplotlib, altair and geopandas. The Shiny Dashboard code involves building a multi-page dashboard that shows a dynamic plot of forest cover evolution from 2001-2020. The second page tourism static trend lines in a comparative set up with a toggle and input list options. To further aid our analysis, we have also performed a Natural Language Processing analysis of various news reports on forest cover data collection and methodology. These news articles were web scraped using BeautifulSoup.
